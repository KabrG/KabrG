### Welcome!
My name is Kabir Guron, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying computer engineering. 
I have a background in Python, C, C++, and some JavaScript. I am primarily interested in electronics, firmware, OS, applied mathematics, and physics.

Feel free to reach me through my email kabirguron@gmail.com if you'd like to work on a side project together or just chat for fun.
